Visual Prolog 5.2 Personal Edition

1. Purpose

Visual Prolog is a complete programming environment based on the
Prolog programming language.

(Visual Prolog is the successor of TURBO Prolog and PDC Prolog).

It contains everything needed for building large-scale commercial
applications: complete graphical development environment, compiler,
linker and debugger.

Visual Prolog includes a large library with bindings to a range of
APIs: Including Windows GUI, ODBC/OCI databases and Internet (sockets,
ftp, http, cgi, etc).

The development environment is written entirely in Visual Prolog,
and contains a number of Code Experts and graphical editors for
dialogs, menus, toolbars etc.

Visual Prolog is very well suited for expert systems, planning and
other AI related problems.

Visual Prolog supports: Windows 3.x/95/98/NT/2000, OS/2 and some
support for DOS, Linux and SCO UNIX


However, this shipment only supports Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP,
other versions are only available on CD (also freeware, but we
charge a fee for handling) see below.


2. Digital signature

To encure its integrity the  installation program (vip52pe.exe) is
digitally signed by

    Prolog Development Center A/S

You can validate this signature by looking at the file properties
of the program in an explorer (right clock the file ans select
properties).


3. Installation

Run the program: vip52pe.exe
